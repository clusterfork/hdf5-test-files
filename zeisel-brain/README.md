# Zeisel brain single-cell RNA-seq dataset

Pretty much as it says on the tin.
This takes the classic 3000-cell dataset from [Zeisel _et al._ (2015)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25700174/) and provides it in the HDF5 or MatrixMarket formats.
Run `generate.R` to construct the files.
We also generate some subsets for quickly testing applications.
