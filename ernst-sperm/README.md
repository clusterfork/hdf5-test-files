# Ernst spermatogenesis single-cell RNA-seq dataset

This takes the spermatogenesis dataset from [Ernst _et al._ (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09182-1) and provides it in the 10X HDF5 or Matrix Market formats.
This is a nice dataset, not least because the t-SNE actually looks like a spermatozoa.
Run `generate.R` to construct the files.
