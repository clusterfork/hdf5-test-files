# 10X Genomics PBMC single-cell RNA-seq dataset

This uses some of the older 10X Genomics test datasets, namely the 3K and 4K PBMC datasets.
These should be some kind of replicatese but I have long forgotten what they are - 
I got them from the [**TENxPBMCData**](https://bioconductor.org/packages/TENxPBMCData) package, so go figure.
Run `generate.R` to construct the files.
