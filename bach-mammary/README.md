# Bach mammary gland single-cell RNA-seq dataset

This takes the mammary gland dataset from [Bach _et al._ (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02001-5) and provides it in the HDF5 or MatrixMarket formats.
I enjoy this dataset because it's got a solid experimental design and also I watched the associated shenanigans around [barcode swapping](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6039488/).
Anyway, I digress: run `generate.R` to construct the files.
